1. Modify trading_system.py to implement a wallet class that keeps track of held stock, held usd, and all transactions for that wallet
2. Implement buy and sell functions for the wallet class to be used by future algorithms that updates the wallet class variables. 
These functions should also perform input validation to make sure no algorithm is cheating (selling more stock than owns, buying more than can afford, etc.)
3. Test each aspect of the wallet class and its functions
