1. Modify trading_system.py and write a function called user_settings. This function will take in user input of wallet size (in dollars), 
as well as the start time, end time, and data point time interval to run the backtesting on then modify the loaded historical data
to fit the users specifications and return the adjusted data.
2. Modify trading_system.py and write a function called get_input that reads in the user input to be passed into the user_settings function
3. Write input validation in user_settings to make sure the users time frame is between the total date range of the historical data as well as handle invalid inputs. 
If the input is invalid, prompt the user as to why and ask for input again
4. Write test functions to test user_settings and edge cases.
