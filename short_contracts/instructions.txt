1. Modify trading_system.py and extend the Wallet class with a new function called short. This function models selling borrowed Bitcoin. It 
takes three parameters: timestamp, price and number(of Bitcoin to short).
2. In the short function, calculate cash and short position changes, validate inputs, and record short sale transactions.
3. Add another function to Wallet class named close_short. This function models buying back borrowed Bitcoin to close a short position. 
It also takes in timestamp, price, and number.
4. Within close_short, calculate cash and short position changes, validate inputs, and record transactions of short position closures.
5. Test short and close_short with different scenarios to ensure they operate properly.
